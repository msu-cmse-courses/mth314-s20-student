Note that many documents in this repository use Markdown as a formatting language, see https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax or https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet for more information and instructions on how to use this. You can read this easily with any text editor, but for proper formatting you should look at it with a Markdown editor (e.g., MacDown for OS X: https://macdown.uranusjr.com/).
