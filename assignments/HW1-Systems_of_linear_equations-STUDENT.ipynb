    "In this problem we will go back to the problem on the [05 pre-class assignment](05--Gauss_Jordan_pre-class-assignment.ipynb), with the Giselle’s earnings as a carpenter and a blacksmith.  In this problem for week 1 she worked a total of 30 hours and earned a total of \\\\$690, where her wages as a carpenter were \\\\$20/hour and as a blacksmith were \\\\$25/hour.  This generated the following set of linear equations:\n",

Giselle spent $1/10$ of her work-setup time and $2/3$ of her work completion time on carpentry, so she spent $9/10$ of her work setup time and $1/3$ of her time on work completion.
